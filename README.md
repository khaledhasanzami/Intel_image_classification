# Intel Image Classification - Image Scene Classification of Multiclass using CNN

## Data
### Dataset:
- The dataset used in the project is named **Intel Image Classification** which is about 352 MB.
- The dataset is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) [Accessed: 19 April, 2021].
## Dataset properties:
- Total number of images: 24K
- Training set size: 14K images 
- Test set size: 3K
- Prediction set size: 7K
- Number of classes: 6 ('buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 )
- Image size: 150x150 pixels
## File type:
- The dataset contains images in jpg format.
- Images are annoted with numbers (Example: 30.jpg)
## Files
There are 3 types of files in the repository:
- Intel.ipynb is the full version of the code used for this analysis
- readme.md explains the repository
- Problem to solve explaines the ongoing work
## Collaboration direction:
- Using a pre-trained model in this scenerio will more likely to yield better accuracy. If any one want to contribute, I would highly suggest to try it out.
